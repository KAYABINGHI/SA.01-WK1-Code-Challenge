# Kenyan Tea Ingridient Calculator


This project is a collection of JavaScript functions designed to perform everyday calculations inspired by Kenyan culture and services. It includes three main utilities:

- Transaction Fee Estimator: Calculates the transaction fee for sending money based on a 1.5% rate, with a minimum fee of KES 10 and a maximum of KES 70.

- Boda Fare Calculator: Estimates the cost of a motorcycle (boda boda) ride based on distance, with a base fare of KES 50 and an additional KES 15 per kilometer.


- Chai Ingredients Calculator: Determines the amount of ingredients needed to make Kenyan chai based on the number of cups, using a standard recipe.

These utilities are built using JavaScript and utilize browser prompts and console outputs for user interaction. The project is a learning exercise to practice JavaScript programming, user input handling, and basic calculation logic.


## Project Setup
